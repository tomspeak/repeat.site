# [Repeat](http://repeat.site)

Allows you to loop a YouTube video fo' eva'.

### Motivation

1. It's 1:28am on Monday and I had nothing better to do
1. I listen to songs on repeat for days but sometimes do not wish the song to be in my music library
1. Most youtube repeat sites were disgustingly bloated and overly complicated
1. Most youtube repeat sites started the video again each time as opposed to seeking, so after a few days you'd racked up some impressive bandwidth on a video you cached every 3 - 4 minutes
1. It was a nice change of pace to write code like it was 2006

### Todo

1. Look into doing this for bandcamp if it won't get me sued.
